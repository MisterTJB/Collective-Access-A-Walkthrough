As still photography was only accepted by the museum, Spong created a simple pinhole camera using a cartridge of super 8 film to produce the work. The filmic outcome is an abstraction of light and its effects. It has no sound. Instead it gives form to the materiality of the film medium and captures the process of the artist producing the work evident by the recorded rhythm of the artist winding on the film. Further colour filters have been applied to intensify the intermittent flickering of the light effects.",,,VUW Art,345615,Victoria University of Wellington Art Collection,Science Building/Room 25,Temporary Storage,13-Aug-15,,Dealer/Purchase,Collection Policy,Jul-11,Victoria University of Wellington Art Collection,

VUW.2014.7,Jacqueline Fahey,"The Opening of Waterloo Bridge ('Whitehall Stairs, June 18th, 1817')","From the 'arbitrary knowledges' series. Chalky pale blue ground with delicately rendered surfaces details, including patches of overlapping white, green, yellow and pink with light pencil scrawlspainted onto hardboard. It is typical of the artists improvisational abstraction which explores the limits of language and seeks to create a space for thought between differing sign systems. In this her titles are highly significant. Not only do they appear hand written on the surface of the work, but they generate a layer of meaning in conversation with the surface details that allows the viewers mind to wander in certain directions. The text of this work is drawn from the lyrics of a Talking Heads song written by David Byrne and Brian Eno, Once in a Lifetime.",,"600 x 820mm (1' 11 5/8"" x 2' 8 5/16"")",General/VUW Art,581576,,Art Building/Room 44,Temporary Exhibit,29-Oct-15,"VICTORIA UNIVERSITY OF WELLINGTON ART COLLECTION FUNDING TRUST, VUW-ACFT",Dealer/Purchase,Collection Policy,25-Nov-14,Victoria University of Wellington Art Collection,

VUW.2014.9,Len Lye,War. The Exile and the Rock Limpet,'Toss' is a scaled up outline of a mortarboard suspended above the Hunter Courtyard. This work replaces Dawsons earlier work Flying Steps (2000) which engaged with the idea of aspirational steps taken to higher levels in education.

VUW.2014.10,Alfred John Tattersall,Yellow Grey Relief,"A selection of fourteen still images and CD soundtrack from the interactive installation 'Citywalk' (1989) originally commissioned by and shown at City Gallery Wellington. The images are taken using Kodak vericolor slide film giving the images a characteristic blue colouring with highlights of magenta and yellow. This film is intended to be used for producing same-size positive transparencies from colour negatives or for making reduced-size transparencies from larger negatives. It has a slow reaction to movement and the outdoor environment causing the images to capture a staggered blurry movement of elements within the picture frame.  In the original installation, moving still images were projected onto the gallery walls. Wireless headphones were supplied to the views with a soundtrack broadcasted via FM radio. This soundtrack was made up of fragments of city noise, conversations, cars, snippets of music and the buzzing of lights.The movement of the images is activated by the movement of the viewers through the space creating an individually experienced soundscape and visual experience. This work places emphasis on the individual experience of the exterior cityscape thereby drawing attention to an interior private and hidden cityscape or the internal mindspace of the city.",,,General/VUW Art,581578,,Art Building/Room 17,"Temporary Storage, Temporary Storage, Temporary Storage, Temporary Storage, Temporary Exhibit","22 Oct 2015, 22 Oct 2015, 22 Oct 2015, 22 Oct 2015, 22 Oct 2015",,Donation,Collection Policy,11-Nov-14,Victoria University of Wellington Art Collection,15

All of these sites feature a section of the view that is presented as a solid block of colour. The viewer is left to determine whether these are the protected zones, or whether they have been singled out by the artist for some other reason. The 24 works are arranged according to these coloured sections, which conform to their place on the grid of a photographic colour picker chart available via the software used by the artist.
